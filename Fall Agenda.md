#Club growth:
##Talk to classes
######CS1
######CS2
######VBA
Make sure they know we're looking for all walks of life. We need someone who wants to set up a website, someone who wants to search for great cheap parts, someone who just wants to put things together, someone who wants to teach, someone who just wants to market, etc.      
##Host an event
Maybe a small workshop on what HPC is and how it works
Show off mini-cluster computer
Talk to Community Councils about spreading the word

#Club Development
#####Set up website
#####Include Google Calendar view
#####Maybe have a view for Github stuff, with link for editing (if a member).
#####Consolidate services for easier handling (?)
Look for a good calendar service that's just a calendar? etc.
     
#Education
#####Software Carpentry lecture things
#####Look into getting registered as teachers for SWC (January?)
#####Host even MORE events. Some just advertised to members, for more in depth?
#####Set up newsletter for people interested? Shamelessly use Jamie's?

#Super Computing
#####Look into funds/sponsorship for building a supercomputer
Talk to companies for funds, ask senate for funds, look into class funds. As much dough as we can get, for a cool one.
#####Set up teams to build and program supercomputer
Get help from peeps. Reach out to HPC people, also maybe talk to professors. We want to get as much staff involved as possible, for more support and credibility. Also easier to recruit with their support.
