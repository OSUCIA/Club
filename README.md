# Club
This is the Oklahoma State University Cyberinfrastructure Association's webpage.  

&nbsp;  

###Join our Slack!  
1. Go to our [Slack webpage](http://osucia.slack.com).
2. Sign up with an account. If you use an osu email address, you can join automatically. If not, you'll need approval to join - send me an email!
3. Be cooler than you were a second ago. (This step is automatic.)

I highly recommend setting up slack on your phone, or atleast setting up emails for events. You can even set it up to send you at most one email per day or week. You'll get information much faster, and be able to contribute to discussion on what we'll do as a club.
