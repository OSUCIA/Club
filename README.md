# OSU Cyberinfrastructure Association
*guiding educational and networking opportunities for OSU students interested in cyberinfrastructure*  

&nbsp;  

## Join us at our next general meeting: Wednesday, February 8 at 4 p.m. in 445 MSCS (Math Sciences). 

&nbsp;

### Join our Slack!  
1. Go to our [Slack webpage](http://osucia.slack.com).
2. Sign up with an account. If you use an osu email address, you can join automatically - just check your email! If not, you'll need approval to join - it should send me an email and I'll get on it quickly.
3. Be cooler than you were a second ago. (This step is automatic.)

I highly recommend setting up slack on your phone, or atleast setting up emails for events. You can even set it up to send you at most one email per day or week. You'll get information much faster, and be able to contribute to discussion on what we'll do as a club.
